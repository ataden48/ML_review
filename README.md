Model for prediction review score RandomForestRegressor

A lot of work with features on creating a predictive model Random Forest Regressor.

The work is demonstrative in nature and aims to show what new features can be extracted from the various available features.

The work shows must-have data processing, coding, and feature engineering skills.

A data frame consisting of 600k rows was taken as the basis of the data and divided into two parts for training the model and checking the results.

The primary and important features were given initially, however, in the course of work, features were also added using third-party sources of information - such as distances from the city center to the hotel.

Also the use of tools for emotional evaluation of the text.

However, the example only shows feature processing and engineering, not including data cleansing.

P.S.
Also, a second notebook was added for an example of evaluating the work of cleaning data, however, cleaning data from outliers and duplicates negatively affected the quality of model predictions.
